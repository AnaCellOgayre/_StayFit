                    <li>Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.</li>
                    <li>Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.</li>

                <h4>Pushups are one of the most basic, yet effective, body weight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.
                    If you can’t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees — you’ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.
